# Season of XoR: Online Training & Internship

## 🚀 Program Vision

The **Season of XoR** is a **4-week guided training + internship-style program** designed for students, beginners, and early-stage developers to **learn by building real-world inspired projects**. Unlike conventional internships, this is a **community-driven, task-based learning experience** where participants choose a technology track, complete structured tasks, and showcase their projects.

At the end of the program:

* 🎓 Receive a **Completion Certificate** (verified by XoR).
* 🌐 Get **Showcase Opportunities** within the XoR Community.
* 💼 Unlock **Referral Opportunities** for outstanding contributors.
* 🤝 Top performers may become **XoR Mentors** in future cohorts.
