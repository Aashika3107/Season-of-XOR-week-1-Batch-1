# 🚀 Season of XoR — Week 1 Instructions

welcome to **batch 1**. this is your starting line.
read carefully. follow everything. no shortcuts.

2. **pick at least 1 track** (web dev, ai/ml, data, web3, agentic ai). you can explore more later, but commit to one now.
3. **complete all week 1 tasks** (see below). no skipping.
4. **submit everything as a PR** → deadline: *next weekend*.
5. **resources are provided** (scroll down). use them, remix them, share them.
